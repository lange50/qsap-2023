# A visual introduction to quantum optics
*Quantum Science at Purdue 2023*

From the quantum of light (the photon) to the quantum of sound (the phonon) every natural phenomenon has a quantum analogue. And with a handful of simple tools, anyone can simulate the quantum world! In this workshop, we use the QuTiP Python package to simulate several interesting systems and gain intuition about quantum mechanics.
